# House-Pricing-Detection
🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
This project demonstrates how to generate a synthetic real estate dataset, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and build a linear regression model to predict house prices based on key features like size, number of bedrooms, location score, and house age.

📦 Project Overview
🔢 Synthetic Dataset of 1,000 samples created using NumPy.

🧹 EDA and Visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

📈 Model Building with LinearRegression from scikit-learn.

📊 Performance Metrics: MAE and R² Score.

🧪 Features Used
size – House size in square feet.

bedrooms – Number of bedrooms.

location – Location score (1 to 10).

age – Age of the house.

Price – Target variable, generated with realistic noise.
